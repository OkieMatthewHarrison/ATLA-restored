EVTDESCduel_in.1;[From.GetFirstName] has exposed [From.GetHerselfHimself] on the battlefield and it is as if [From.GetSheHe] is brought to me on a silver platter. The moment is most oppertune!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_ent.1;Fire is power! Strength is all I need to persevere!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel_ent.1;The wind is freedom. I shall decide what happens in this battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel_ent.1;The waters are ever-changing under the eternal Moon. ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDduel_ent.1;The very earth under my feet shall obey me. ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFduel_ent.1;I shall draw my weapon and my enemy will know my strength!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEduel_ent.1;A wise fighter knows when it is brave to enter a battle and when it is foolish - today is the latter.;;;;;;;;;x
"EVTDESCAduel.1;""[From.GetFirstName]'s strong will and determination allows [From.GetHerHim] to quickly overpower me with a flurry of flames. I try my best to think of a way to counter my opponent but I must not ponder; it is now or never!"";;;;;;;;;x"
EVTDESCBduel.1;After masterfully evading several attacks, [From.GetFirstName] has stopped avoiding me and is now facing me! A single soaring wind blast is heading my way. I must now be decisive: what is my next action?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel.1;Spikes of ice and liquid surges home in on me from [From.GetFirstName], whose determination is not easily dissolved. The clear water is elegantly flowing around [From.GetFirstName] and [From.GetSheHe] is preparing for an attack. Now is the chance!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFduel.1;Though not a bender, my opponent [From.GetFirstName] should not be underestimated. After a short but intense dance, [From.GetSheHe] allows me to respond in kind.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel.1;My opponent [From.GetFirstName] makes the ground beneath me roar like a mighty lion elephant and shards of rock rise to do [From.GetHerHis] bidding. [From.GetFirstName] makes a move. This presents an opening to me and I must decide quickly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAduel.1;Hit the most vital organs;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel.1;Strike the torso region;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel.1;Strike the limbs;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDduel.1;Flee;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEduel.1;I must maintain balance and choose which element I shall use.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAduel.2;I look in amazement as the battle has caused more damage to the once-beautiful vista than it has to me. My opponent's relentless use of force has made [From.GetHerHim] forget to maintain [From.GetHerHis] defenses. You now have an opening in which to act!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel.2;[From.GetFirstName] is an apt opponent and [From.GetSheHe] uses sudden stealthy strikes and quickly evades any of the attacks I throw at [From.GetHerHim], as befits an airbender. Suddenly however, my opponent makes a poor judgement call and I have an opening to respond!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel.2;The earth has been dificult to stand on, both from [From.GetFirstName]'s attacks and attempts to throw me off balance. As [From.GetFirstName] prepares another attack I see an opening!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel.2;My clothes are soaked and I'm freezing up. The floor is slippery, both from the muddied earth and the random bits of ice lying around. [From.GetFirstName]'s attacks continue. As [From.GetSheHe]  takes a fraction too long drawing water from [From.GetHerHis] waterpack I have a chance!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel.2;[From.GetFirstName] has closed in on me and metal is now clashing a mere arm's length from my face. My opponent is not to be called an unskilled fighter, sustaining my onslaught for so long. It can't last, however, as you manage to sense an opportune moment at which to act!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCduel.100;Something;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel.100;Something;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.1;The heat is too strong and [From.GetFirstName] formidle attacks has pushed me back. As my defenses were down [From.GetSheHe] strikes a last time and the lights fade.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.1;The wind are strong and [From.GetFirstName] has thrown me up and down against the ground. As I land a last time I feel a blinding pain at the back of my head.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.1;[From.GetFirstName] has finally got the advantage and my lack of attacks has leaved me open to attacks. A last attack from [From.GetFirstName] sends a large boulder against me...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.1;My clothes is soaked and a chill has finally reached my bones. [From.GetFirstName] sets [From.GetHerHis] final attack in and body is locked in frozen water. My arms can't move and everything is cold.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.1;[From.GetFirstName] is clearly used to close combat and my attacks find no room and my defences is being pulled apart. [From.GetFirstName]'s clup finally meets my head and I fall back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.1;This is the end...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.2;A long battle has raged between us. An attack has been blocked by a defence and my energy is soon ended. [From.GetFirstName] sees my wavering concentration and strikes me to the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.2;Everyone of my attacks agains [From.GetFirstName] has been avoided and several of [From.GetHerHis] attacks has hit me. Suddenly I feel my feet being sweeped off the ground. The world spin once or twice and I suddenly hit the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.2;Hindering and launching my own attacks has been exhausting but [From.GetFirstName] is unstoppable. The ground has been shaken under me and suddenly a rock at the size of my head is coming towards me. I get thrown back and land on my back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.2;A fast series of water and ice spears has been thrown against me and most I've avoided. As I lauch my own attack [From.GetFirstName] push me down with a large wave from the exess of water the battle has left behind.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.2;[From.GetFirstName] relentlessly attacks me and I can barely manage a defence. Even though I try my best too late I notice a quick punch to my face and I fall back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.2;[From.GetFirstName] now has me...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.3;A quick array of small burst of fires against me suddenly stop and I see [From.GetFirstName] flee from the fight.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.3;After having avoided my attacks and hindered [From.GetHerHis] attacks I notice [From.GetFirstName] vanish in a cloud of dust.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.3;It seems my attacks has been successful. [From.GetFirstName] has dropped [From.GetHerHis] attacks and is now fleeing the battle!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.3;Even after the attacks of [From.GetFirstName] suddenly [From.GetFirstName] has turned [From.GetHerHis] back to me and is running away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.3;My superiority has finally resulted in [From.GetFirstName] turning [From.GetHerHis] back to me and runs away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.3;Fear me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.4;[From.GetFirstName] has finally put me on my bag and the fury is burning in [From.GetHerHis] eyes and I have a choice!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.4;I'm begging you!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.5;[From.GetFirstName] is laying on the floor is begging for [From.GetHerHis] life. What should I do?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.5;I accept and you can go!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel_out.5;I spare you, but you wil be my prisoner;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel_out.5;I decline and this ends here!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.100;[From.GetFirstName] is before me lifeles. A terrible ending to the battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.100;I should never have happened like this...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.101;[From.GetFirstName] has been incapicated and now I can put [From.GetHerHim] in my custody!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.101;This should end this!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPduel_out.4;You beg for mercy and to let you go;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCtraining.1;My guardian is a skilled bender while my own skills can't compare. Even though I train everyday, maybe I could need some help?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.1;Maybe I should ask my guardian for help?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.1;No!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.2;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is training everyday with me, but I still got some techniques to learn [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.2;I will learn you my techniques;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.2;It should come naturally;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.3;Even though I asked [From.GetFirstName] about [From.GetHerHis] techniques [From.GetSheHe] refused. Apparantly I'm supposed to advance on my own...;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.3;That's disapointing...;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.3;Then I will learn it by myself!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.4;Lately [From.GetFirstName] has devoted more and more time to teach me [From.GetHerHis] own techniques and I'm sure I'll improve soon enough!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.4;The hard work begins now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.5;My ward is training hard and is striving to achive my level of skill. Maybe I should give a helping hand?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.5;Yes, I should help!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.5;Maybe it's better not to...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.6;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has noticed my hard work to reach [From.GetHerHis] level of technique and now offered a helping hand with achiving that goal.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.6;I will learn your techniques;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.6;Why bother?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.7;My technique is near flawless and control over my element is increasing. Even though I've improved, it's clear my guardian is still better.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.7;Maybe I could learn this special technique you have?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.7;It seems like too much work...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.8;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has showed increased interest in my specialized technique and now wants to learn it. It's a difficult technique and maybe too difficult for [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.8;It's too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.8;I will show [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.9;My [GetFromRelation] is a brilliant bender, but unfurtunately [From.GetSheHe] deemed it too dangerous for me...;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.9;How sad..;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.10;My [GetFromRelation] is a brilliant bender and [From.GetSheHe] deemed me ready to try one of the most advanced techniques [From.GetSheHe] knows.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.10;Yay!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.11;I'm beyond dispute a skilled bender and my understanding of my element is only growing day by day. Today I worked on a new advanced technique I came up with myself and it seems like it is working beyond belief!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.11;This is only the beginning!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.12;A very good friend of mine have developed a very advanced technique and is boasting of the feat.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.12;I should ask for help with achieving the same thing!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.12;It's exaggerated!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.13;After many setbacks and bruises I finally have something to show for it. My bending technique is smoother and control of my element stronger.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.13;I've improved!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.14;I've suffered many bruises and setbacks in pursuit of improving my bending. Despite of this I've got nothing to show for it. ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.14;All that work...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.101;My friend is an excellent bender and is one of the few I know, who has specialized and developed a certain brand of bending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.101;I will ask for help with my technique!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.101;I can make it on my own!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.102;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has long admired my bending ability and has finally asked for my help.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.102;I will help for free!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.102;Perhaps a small compensation for the danger?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCtraining.102;Not my concern;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.103;I asked [From.GetFirstName] for help with learning such an advanced move and [From.GetSheHe] agreed to help me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.103;Let the lesson begin;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.104;I asked [From.GetFirstName] for help with learning such an advanced move and [From.GetSheHe] agreed to help me for a price.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.104;I will accept.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.104;That is too expensive!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.105;I reached out to [From.GetFirstName] for help with advancing my bending but I was flat out refused. Maybe it is time to rethink this friendship?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.105;Maybe he isn't my friend.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.105;This shouldn't come between us!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.106;Even though I'm no longer young, my knowledge and power has been growing. Maybe I should focus my energy on a special technique?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.106;I've learned a new technique;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.106;I already know enough;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.107;As the seasons go by and my lifetime comes closer to an end, the new generation should take over. My strenth has been weakened and now it is time for the children to take over.;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTfirelordA.8;They can whisper all they want...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.8;Banish all the traitors!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.9;Terror has spread throughout the Capitol as sightings of Dark Spirits grow in number. People whisper that they steal children in the night, and so far, the city guard have been powerless to stop them.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.9;What kind of evil creatures are these?;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.10;As the Dark Spirits continue to sow terror, people are fleeing the Capitol in droves into the countryside. Even the Ministers and the members of the Imperial Guard have begun to flee.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.10;Let the cowards run!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.10;Shut the gates! Nobody leaves me!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.11;Word has come that some upstart child has claimed to be a long lost descendent of House Hong and rightful Firelord. As much as you've spent hours laughing, your courtiers continue to insist his supporters are growing in numbers.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.11;I'm still laughing, but go ahead and kill them.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.12;Recently, Firelord [From.GetFirstName] has been behaving extremely erratically. Some even say our ruler has even gone mad, whispering and babbling about spirits and traitors. Whatever it is, it may lead our nation to ruin unless this is stopped.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.12;This is concerning.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.13;Our Firelord has certainly gone mad and now news is spreading not only is the Capitol in chaos, but a young Lord of House Hong is leading a rebellion to reclaim the throne. We must choose whether our loyalties lie to our Firelord or to this upstart.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.13;Our loyalty is to the Firelord!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.13;We must help the Prince restore sanity!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.14;The very next night, you meet with the Fire Sages in the Capitol Temple. They assure you they will look into any Spiritual disturbances that may be going on, but until then, they advise you to rest.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.14;I am grateful for their help.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.15;A Fire Sage has finally replied to your request for aid. Apparently, he believes that your unease may be caused by Spiritual disturbance in the Capitol. He requests your permission to accompany you into the Dragonbone Catacombs to find the source of this trouble.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.15;Into the Catacombs? I'm not going down there.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.15;Let us go then.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.16;Journeying into the Catacombs, tomb of all Firelords before you, the Sage comes across legends of the time before the Fire Nation. The tale speaks of Dark Spirits known as Kemurikage who sowed terror among the warlords, scattering their petty kingdoms to the winds.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.16;Fascinating.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.17;When the first Firelord united the islands, the Kemurikage retreated into the Spirit World as the conflict that spawned them ended. Now however, with the line of that Firelord ended, they have returned to restore balance.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.17;Great Spirits, how may I appease you?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.17;I'm leaving, this is a fool's tale.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.18;The Sage begins a ritual to try and catch the attention of these Spirits, but pleads with you to take absolute caution when dealing with such entities. He warns you a wicked soul may incur their wraith.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.18;Summon them.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.18;I should leave.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.19;The Spirits are angered by your presence, and they attack. They descend upon you, their lifeless eyes gazing into you. You wake up in the Royal Chambers. Nobody has heard of what happened, and you're left unsure if it even happened.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.19;It's all just a dream. Hahahaha...;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.20;The Spirits arrive, and after a moment studying you, seem contented, disappearing as fast as they appeared. The Sage is unsure if they are appeased, but believes that something will change. You leave the Catacombs behind, hoping something came of this.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTfirelord.20;Hopefully this is over.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.21;After a month, you have no longer been having any troubling dreams as of late. There has been no more disturbances, and it appears this Spiritual crisis is over.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.21;What a relief.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11053_WATERBENDING_HEALER;A traveller recently arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It appears this wanderer is a Waterbending Healer, by the name of [recruited_physician_target.GetFirstName] and has been healing local residents. Perhaps [recruited_physician_target.GetSheHe] could stay as our Healer?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.104;Recently, [Root.GetBestName], has talked repeatedly with me about [From.Religion.GetName]. It is clear that he wishes me to adapt a similar way of thinking, and admissibly, I feel I should.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.104;Then maybe it is the right way of thinking.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAB.104;No, I think I prefer my ways for now.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCavatar.193;Recently, [From.GetName], has visited your home on [From.GetHerHis] journeys. Though they have stayed only a few short weeks, you can tell something is quickly growing between the two of you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.193;I think I'm in love;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.193;No, it's not appropriate.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.194;For the past few weeks, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been visiting your province, and now, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] and [From.GetBestName] has come before you and asked permission to marry. You were not aware there was something brewing between the two, but both seem quite certain of their love.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.194;I will allow it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.194;I cannot allow it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.197;Recently, you received a visitor, one [From.GetBestName]. It appears [From.GetSheHe] is looking for a new employer, and has come to ask permission to join your court.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.197;Of course there is room for you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.197;There is no place for you here.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.198;It appears [FromFrom.GetBestName] has decided to leaving home, setting off to join [From.GetBestName]'s court.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatar.198;[From.GetBestName] will be missed.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.200;Word has come that Avatar [From.GetFirstName] is coming to our aid in our struggle, bringing allies to our defence!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatar.200;I dare hope this may be enough to save us.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.201;Our commanders are reporting that reinforcements are coming to the aid of our enemies, led by none other than Avatar [From.GetFirstName]. It appears the Avatar has rallied others to [From.GetHerHis] cause in [From.GetHerHis] efforts against us.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatar.201;[From.GetSheHeCap] cannot hope to halt our entire army...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.205;With the death of [From.GetFirstName], you know yet more sorrow. You also feel the burning desire for revenge, knowing your dear [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was murdered by [FromFrom.GetBestName]. For this crime, there must be punishment.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.206;There is a thundering crash, as Avatar [From.GetFirstName] intrudes into your throne room with eyes burning bright. With terrifying power, they hover over you as your guards flee in fear. There are no words, but you know, they have come to avenge [FromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.208;Word has come to you, that the vile [FromFrom.GetBestName] has abducted your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. This barbarity must not go unavenged.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.209;There is a thundering crash, as Avatar [From.GetFirstName] intrudes into your throne room with eyes burning bright. With terrifying power, they hover over you as your guards flee in fear. There are no words, but you know, they have come to rescue [FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.205;My vengeance will be swift.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.205;As Avatar, I must restrain myself, for my own sake.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.206;If I must kill you Avatar, then I shall!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.206;Avatar, I beg for mercy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarC.206;MERCY PLEASE!!!;;;;;;;;;x
